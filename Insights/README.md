Executive insights and business summary : 

## Executive Summary ##

This project analyzes retail sales and profitability using the Superstore dataset
to identify revenue drivers, margin risks, and regional performance gaps.

Key findings show that while overall sales exceed $2.29M, profitability is uneven.
The West region leads in sales, but the East region delivers stronger profit margins.

The Furniture category consistently underperforms on profit due to aggressive
discounting, while Technology remains the strongest revenue and profit contributor.

Strategic focus should be placed on optimizing discount strategies, improving
Furniture category margins, and strengthening performance in the South region.
